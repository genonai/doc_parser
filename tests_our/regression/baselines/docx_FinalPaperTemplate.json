Use the word “Abstract” as the title, in 12-point Times, boldface type, centered relative to the column, initially capitalized. The abstract is to be in 10-point, single-spaced type. Leave two blank lines after the Abstract, then begin the main text. Look at previous CVPR abstracts to get a feel for style and length.*\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nPlease follow the steps outlined below when submitting your manuscript to the IEEE Computer Society Press. This style guide now has several important modifications (for example, you are no longer warned against the use of sticky tape to attach your artwork to the paper), so all authors should read this new version.\n\n### 1.1 Language\n\nAll manuscripts must be in English.\n\n### 1.2 Dual submission\n\nPlease refer to the author guidelines on the CVPR 2023 web page for a discussion of the policy on dual submissions.\n\n### 1.3 Paper length\n\nPapers, excluding the references section, must be no longer than eight pages in length. The references section will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the length of the references section. For example, a paper of eight pages with two pages of references would have a total length of 10 pages. **There will be no extra page charges for CVPR 2023** .\n\nOverlength papers will simply not be reviewed. This includes papers where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those laid down by this style guide. Note that this guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font. The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for supervised revisions of manuscripts. The reviewing process cannot determine the suitability of the paper for presentation in eight pages if it is reviewed in eleven.\n\n### 1.4 The ruler\n\nThe LaTeX style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the version submitted for review. The ruler is provided in order that reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without circumlocution. If you are preparing a document using a non-LaTeX document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to appear on the final output pages. The presence or absence of the ruler should not change the appearance of any other content on the page. The camera-ready copy should not contain a ruler.\n\nReviewers: note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper — this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly. Just use fractional references ( *e.g.,* this line is 180.5), although in most cases one would expect that the approximate location will be adequate.\n\n### 1.5 Paper ID\n\nMake sure that the Paper ID from the submission system is visible in the version submitted for review (replacing the “****” you see in this document).\n\n### 1.6 Mathematics\n\nPlease number all of your sections and displayed equations as in these examples:\n\n$$E=m \\cdot c^{2} \\# \\left(1\\right)$$\n\nand\n\n$$v=a \\cdot t. \\# \\left(2\\right)$$\n\nFigure 1: Example of a figure with caption.  Captions are set in roman, 9 point.  Use a Drawing area to make space for figures.\n\nIt is important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation. Just because you did not refer to it in the text does not mean some future reader might not need to refer to it. It is cumbersome to have to use circumlocutions like “the equation second from the top of page 3 column 1”. (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not an alternative to equation numbers). All authors will benefit from reading Mermin’s description of how to write mathematics: [http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf](http:/www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf) .\n\n### 1.7 Blind review\n\nMany authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind review. Blind review does not mean that one must remove citations to one’s own work—in fact it is often impossible to review a paper unless the previous citations are known and available.\n\nBlind review means that you do not use the words “my” or “our” when citing previous work. That is all. (But see below for tech reports.)\n\nSaying “this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [1]” does not say that you are Lucy Smith, it says that you are building on her work. If you are Smith and Jones, do not say “as we show in [7]”, say “as Smith and Jones show in [7]” and at the end of the paper, include reference 7 as you would any other cited work.\n\nAn example of a bad paper just asking to be rejected:\n\nAn analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.\n\nIn this paper we present a perfo",
